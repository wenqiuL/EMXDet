EMXDet: An X-ray prohibited object  detection method based on  edge-aware enhancement and multi-scale dynamic fusion
X-ray prohibited object detection plays a critical role in ensuring public security. Unlike natural images, X-ray images often present unique challenges such as background noise interference, significant variation in object scales, and severe occlusion and overlap among items. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel detection method named EMXDet (Edge-aware Multi-scale X-ray Detection), which is based on edge-aware enhancement and multi-scale dynamic fusion. The proposed approach integrates three key innovative modules: the Adaptive Binarization and Texture Fusion module (ABTF), the Dynamic Group Feature Mixer module (DGF Mixer), and the Dynamic Factor-enhanced Deformable Regression module (DFDR).Specifically, the ABTF module enhances image quality during the preprocessing stage by emphasizing low-contrast targets. The DGF Mixer module, embedded within the backbone network, aggregates multi-scale convolutional features using a dynamic weight fusion mechanism combined with global contextual awareness, effectively addressing scale variation and occlusion challenges. The DFDR module adaptively adjusts convolutional kernel weights to improve classification and localization accuracy. Experimental results on three public datasets,SIXray, PIXray, and CLCXray,demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates issues such as object occlusion, overlap, and noise interference in X-ray images, and significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of prohibited object detection.
